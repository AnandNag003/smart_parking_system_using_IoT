The proposed system will have IR sensor, Arduino Uno, ESP8266-01 Wi-Fi Module,  Cloud server i.e. www.thingspeak.com, User-End Application on Smartphone. The interfacing is  shown.. The ultrasonic sensor is used to determine the availability of the vehicle at the parking  spot. It is connected to the Arduino Uno module interfaced with Wi-Fi shield [5]. The Arduino  Uno module is connected to the cloud server through an Internet connection to transfer the data  from the local car park. At the user end application a software system runs on Android operating  system. The user has to install this application on their smart phones and use it to reserve parking  spaces.
